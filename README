Task::BeLike::RJRAY - My frequently-used and favorite modules
=============================================================

Version: 0.004 (See CHANGES below)


WHAT IS IT
----------

This is my entry in the "simplify my new Perl bootstrap process" bandwagon. I
don't actually think anyone wants to BE like me, but if this proves to be
helpful or inspirational to someone else, I can live with that.


CHANGES
-------

  * Build.PL

I clearly did not understand how this worked before now.

  * lib/Task/BeLike/RJRAY.pm

Corrected version number.
